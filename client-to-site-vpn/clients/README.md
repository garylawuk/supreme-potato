# Clients

This directory contains a handful of example certificates.  These certificates will _not_ work for you if you are following the instructions here. They are included so you can compare these with the certificates generated in your installation.  An ECDSA .p12 file is required for all devices.  An ECDSA Root Certificate may also be required seperately, although it is bundled into the .p12.

This directory contains a couple of sub directories with instructions for configuring Microsoft Windows and Apple iOS and macOS devices to connect to your demonstration firewall.
